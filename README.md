# Angular boilerplate
Angular 11 boilerplate with [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre), i18n, static prerendering and some common resources.

## Getting started
Install everything with `npm install`, then:
- `npm start` to start the project locally on [http://localhost:4200]() (accessible through local network)
- `npm run start:fr` does the same using the French locale
- `npm lint` to lint (the default configuration has not been modified)
- `npm run extract` to extract the source language file in **src/locale**
- `npm run build` to build for production, files are generated in **dist/angular-boilerplate/browser**
- `npm run prerender` does the same but it also prerenders routes defined in the **prerender** configuration in **angular.json**

## Features
### Styling
[Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre), a lightweight CSS framework, is included with its set of pure CSS icons [Icons.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/icons.css).

### i18n
i18n is done with the native package. It is currently configured to be in English in the source code and to have a French translation. The exact configuration is detailed below.

### Common resources
#### Directives
- `AutofocusDirective`: dynamically focuses an element

#### Pipes
- `ConcatPipe`
- `ForObjectPipe`: iterates through the keys of an object
- `JoinPipe`
- `LastElementPipe`: returns the last element of an array
- `SplitPipe`
- `ToFixedPipe`

## Structure
### @core
`CoreModule` is supposed to contain global services and models. There are a few other useful files:
- **core.constants.ts** to store application constants (not to be confused with **environment.ts**)
- **core.utils.ts** to store simple functions you want to be able to use everywhere

### @theme
`ThemeModule` is supposed to contain global resources which can be used in templates (components, directives, pipes, etc.). You can also find a folder named **styles** containing the following files:
- **custom-spectre.css.scss** imports and configures Spectre.css
- **main.scss** defines global styles
- **variables.scss** stores global SCSS variables

### @modules
This is supposed to contain modules which are likely to be imported in various places in the application.

## Configuration
The project has been initialized with *Angular CLI* and then modified.

### Debugging
**.vscode/launch.json** allows to attach the debugger to *Chrome*.

### i18n
i18n has been configured like this:
- the source code is in English and there is a French translation
- language files are stored in **src/locale**
- the build command builds all the locales configured
- the base HREF is empty for the source code language and set as the language code for the translations
- a missing translation throws an error and stops the build

### Routing
Nonexistent routes are redirected to home and scroll position restoration is enabled.
